            <h4> The Great Divide</h4>

            <p>
                In the world of web programming, there was once
                conflict. The burden of grouping text was left to the
                <span>monkeys</span> whose skills in such areas were so
                lacking that they could do little more than press the
                <b><i>Enter</i></b> key over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then there came the <span>DIV</span> and the <span>SPAN
                </span>. Lo these mighty tags brought peace to the reqalm
                and the <span>monkeys</span> lived happily ever after.

                This text is a complete fabrication and utter nonsense.
                The management takes no responsibility for anyone who
                believes that any of this has any basis in fact.
